This project was mainly created out of minor frustration of the built in icon viewer add-on, but also to learn some JavaScript.

All of the names you copy are derived from the filename on the official Blender UI website, there may be descrepancies with the copied name and the actual name in bpy. This means the icon was not named properly either when creating the UI icons or when creating the bpy API. If you come across something like this, please open an issues ticket here so I can fix them and we can all work on improving Blender.

None of the icons are mine, they are publicly available through the official website here: https://ui.blender.org/icons

**Future plans**
Add a search bar so you can search for icons easily and quickly just like in Blender.
Add a download button which converts the SVG to a PNG for creators to use in videos.
Add additional options for copying code already formatted correctly to use in Blender Python e.g. ", icon='MESH_DATA'".
